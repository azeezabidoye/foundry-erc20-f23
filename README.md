- It is important we understand that, the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem is fundamentally democratic and open source.
- As such, major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche often implement methods by which the community can submit suggestions for changes in methodologies and their standards.
- These suggestions and opinions are typically known as `Improvement Proposals`.
- NB: Improvement can be anything. They can be anything from a core blockchain update to some standard that is going to be a best practice for the entire community to adopt.
- Therefore, in Ethereum, they are called `Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)`.
- If a proposed `EIP` gets traction to warrant genuine consideration, then they will often generate `Request for Comments`.
- These are known as `Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs)`.
- It is worthy to note that `EIPs` and `ERCs` are numbered chronologically i.e `ERC20` is the 20th request for comment that was created.
