- It is important we understand that, the Web3 and blockchain ecosystem is fundamentally democratic and open source.
- As such, major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche often implement methods by which the community can submit suggestions for changes in methodologies and their standards.
- These suggestions and opinions are typically known as `Improvement Proposals`.
- NB: Improvement can be anything. They can be anything from a core blockchain update to some standard that is going to be a best practice for the entire community to adopt.
- Therefore, in Ethereum, they are called `Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)`.
- If a proposed `EIP` gets traction to warrant genuine consideration, then they will often generate `Request for Comments`.
- These are known as `Ethereum Request for Comments (ERCs)`.
- It is worthy to note that `EIPs` and `ERCs` are numbered chronologically i.e `ERC20` is the 20th request for comment that was created.

## ERC20

- Ethereum Request for Comment - Number 20.
- ERC20 Token Standard is the proposal in which the methodology for creating and managing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain was tabled.
- This is an improvement proposal that talks about how to actually create token and create smart contract tokens.
- `ERC20` are tokens that are deployed on-chain using the ERC20 Token Standard.
- Basically ERC20 is a smart contract that actually represents a token...
- ...be it a token or a smart contract, its both and its cool
- Tether, Chainlink, Unitoken and DAI are all examples of ERC20.
